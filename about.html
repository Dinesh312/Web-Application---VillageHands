            “It was an amazing experience to work alongside this great artist.
            Bhajju is such an endearing person, his simplicity and down to earth
            persona really moved me. And what an incredible imagination he has
            which he puts down on paper with amazing talent. The balance of
            colours and intricate detailing were a delight to watch. So happy to
            be part of this workshop". - <b><strong>Yashashri Shetty</strong></b

            crafts in an organic natural environment. It is a wonderful space
            that would help free flow of ideas and creativity. It has a
            wonderful library collection and an inspiring space. It is a
            beautiful project and I am sure with Iti's vision and Mr. Somesh's
            extensive experience, it will grow and prosper to give future
            generations an exposure and passion for crafts, and provide
            sustainable growth to the crafts itself". -
